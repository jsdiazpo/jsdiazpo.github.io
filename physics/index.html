	<p>For more 
	than ten years I had the opportunity of doing physics research at a 
	professional level. During my early years, my interest in nuclear fusion led 
	me to do experimental work at a 
	plasma-physics laboratory; later, my research topics included black-hole 
	thermodynamics, theoretical particle physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, 
	and high-energy astrophysics. </p>
	<p>Despite 
	the wide range of research areas that I explored, they were all aligned in 
	the long term with the scientific question that captured my interest: the 
	matter-antimatter imbalance in the early universe, which is usually 
	rephrased as <em><strong>why is there something, rather of nothing?</strong></em> The 
	existence of the universe as we know it is the consequence of a minute 
	excess of matter over antimatter after the big bang due to a process known as baryogenesis. In 
	1967, three conditions were identified as the basic prerequisites for 
	baryogenesis to occur and all conventional studies in the past half century 
	have made use of these conditions as their starting point. It was discovered 
	in 1995 that one of these conditions could be relaxed if tiny deviations 
	from an exact symmetry known as CPT invariance are allowed, opening a new 
	way to explore the origin of baryogenesis. CPT symmetry is 
	an ingredient of all well-established theoretical physics (known as 
	relativistic quantum field theory and general relativity); hence, CPT 
	violation would imply not only a way to explain the observed universe and our 
	existence but also would led to a paradigm shift at the core of fundamental 
	physics.</p>
	<p>My PhD 
	work consisted in the theoretical study of the breakdown of spacetime 
	symmetries (Lorentz and CPT invariance) and the corresponding effects that 
	would arise in neutrino experiments. These studies triggered a series of 
	experimental searches of Lorentz and CPT violation using particle 
	accelerators, nuclear reactors, and natural sources of these ghostly 
	particles. Later, I extended these studies to cosmic messengers: 
	astrophysical neutrinos, astrophysical gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Please

	<p>In addition to my work as a researcher, for years I have also shared physics 
	with the general public through a blog in Spanish for non experts called
